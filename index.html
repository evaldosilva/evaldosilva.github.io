<h2>SENIOR FULLSTACK DEVELOPER</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I am Evaldo, a dedicated professional who really loves learn cool things.</p>
<p>With more than 16 years on IT sector, I am still fresh to leanr and teach. Actually, this is the key point I have decided for this profession. 
  IT is a really dynamic area that changes in every minute, and that is exciting.</p>

<p>When not programming, I like to travel and do some kind of adventure stuff, like trails or sports.</p>
