            With <b>16+ years in the IT sector</b>, I’ve never lost my passion
            for learning and teaching. That’s why I chose this field: technology
            evolves by the minute, and that thrill of constant growth keeps me
            energized. Whether it’s mastering a new tool, optimizing systems, or
            sharing knowledge with peers, I believe curiosity and adaptability
            are the keys to staying ahead.

          <p>
            When I’m not coding or troubleshooting, you’ll find me exploring
            trails, traveling to new places, or diving into adrenaline-fueled
            sports. Adventure fuels my creativity, both in tech and life!
