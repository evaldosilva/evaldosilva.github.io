            With <b>16+ years in the IT sector</b>, I’ve never lost my passion
            for learning and teaching. That’s why I chose this field: technology
            evolves by the minute, and that thrill of constant growth keeps me
            energized. Whether it’s mastering a new tool, optimizing systems, or
            sharing knowledge with peers, I believe curiosity and adaptability
            are the keys to staying ahead.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I’m not coding or troubleshooting, you’ll find me exploring
            trails, traveling to new places, or diving into adrenaline-fueled
            sports. Adventure fuels my creativity, both in tech and life!

            collaborate on projects, or swap travel stories!

          <h3>IT Background</h3>
          <p>
            I have started early on IT, right after the graduation. I consider
            myself lucky because I could start my carreer while studying and
            never need to change, so I had the opportunity to be on contact with
            programming languages my whole life.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is where I say I could and still surf a lot of tech waves. For
            curiosity, besides C#, Asp.Net, SQL language and Angular be my
            strongest areas of proficiency, I already worked with ABAP on SAP
            ECC, HANA, Netweaver Process Integration, Java, Java Server Pages
            and Delphi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Big Data is on my radar as well, and that is why I did a Masters
            Degree on this area. Now we see IA and Chatbots as ChatGPT and
            DeepSeek as hot trending topics, but Prediction and Forecast have a
            strong potential as well, specially for companies.
          </p>

          <h3>Business Background</h3>
          <p>
            Talking about business areas, I already have worked on Education,
            Banking and Accounting, where I have spent most part of my carreer.
          </p>
          <p>
            These areas have a lot of common aspects, when talking about data
            volume, kind of information and closing cycles (month-end close,
            year-close, reconciliations, reporting and so on).
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge in combining IT with these areas is to provide users
            with smart tools that streamline their processes—where they are the
            specialists—while ensuring compliance with regulations (such as
            GDPR, RGAA, MiFID II, etc.) without restricting their ability to
            make necessary adjustments. All of this must be achieved in a
            resilient and high-performing manner, of course.
